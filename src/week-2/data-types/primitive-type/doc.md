## Primitive Data Types:

A primitive type has **_a fixed size in memory_**. For example, a number occupies eight bytes of memory, and a boolean value can be represented with only one bit. The number type is the largest of the primitive types. If each JavaScript variable reserves eight bytes of memory, the variable can directly hold any primitive value.

### String:

Represents textual data.

```
Example: let str = "Hello, World!"
```

### Number:

Represents numeric data, both integers and floating-point numbers.

```
Example: let num = 42
```

### Boolean:

Represents a logical entity and has two values: true or false.

```
Example: let isTrue = true;
```

### Null:

Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

```
Example: let myNull = null;
```

### Undefined:

Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

```
Example: let myUndefined;
```

### Symbol:

Introduced in ECMAScript 6, represents a unique identifier.

```
Example: let sym = Symbol("unique");
```

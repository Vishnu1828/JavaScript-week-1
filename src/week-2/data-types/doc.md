# Data Types

- A data type describes a set of values and the operations possible on those values.

* JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning that the data type of a variable is not explicitly declared. Instead, it is determined at runtime. Understanding these data types is crucial for effective JavaScript programming.

- JavaScript has several data types that can be broadly categorized into two groups: primitive types and object types.

## Primitive Data Types:

1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. Null
5. Undefined
6. Symbol

## Reference Data Types:

1. Object
2. Array
3. Function
4. Data

## typeof

The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand's value.
